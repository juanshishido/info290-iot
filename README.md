### Course description

> This course looks at the “Internet of Things” (IoT) as the general theme of
physical/real-world things becoming increasingly visible and actionable via
Internet and web technologies. The goal of the course is to look top-down as
well as bottom-up, to provide students with a comprehensive understanding of
the IoT:
>
> * By looking at a variety of real-world application scenarios of the IoT and
    diverse implemented applications, the various understandings and
    requirements of IoT applications become apparent. This allows students to
    understand what IoT technologies are used for today, and what is required
    in certain scenarios.
> * By looking at a variety of existing and developing technologies and
    architectural principles, students gain a better understanding of the
    types of technologies that are available and in use today and can be
    utilized to implement IoT solutions.
> * Finally, students will be given the opportunity to apply these technologies
    to tackle scenarios of their choice in teams of two or three, using an
    experimental platform for implementing prototypes and testing them as
    running applications. At the end of the semester, all project teams will
    present their completed projects.
>
> This course is looking at technical and business aspects of the Internet of
Things. There will be project groups that tackle projects looking at specific
application scenarios. This is not primarily an implementation-focused course
and different skill levels of programming are welcome, but some familiarity
with programming is expected.
